    1. Brown pork and beef in a large skillet.
    2. Dice/chop the vegetables.
    3. Rinse and drain the beans.
    4. Combine everything in a slow cooker and cook on low for at least 8 hours. Kinda hard to overcook this. 
    5. Enjoy

This is a pretty low effort chili recipe I developed in college. The spice level is easily variable if your audience requires more or less heat. Normally served with cheesy mashed potatoes or rice if you prefer.

Personally I would add 1-3 Thai chili peppers or something similar in heat value before going over 1 tablespoon of cayenne. This prevents excess cayenne powder turning gritty and builds a more complex spice flavor.
